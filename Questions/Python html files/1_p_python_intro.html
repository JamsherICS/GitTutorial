      <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python is designed to emphasize code readability and ease of use.</p>
  
      <h4>Some Key Features:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong style="color: #28a745;">Readability and Simplicity:</strong> Python's syntax is clear and easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners and allowing developers to write clean and maintainable code.</li>
        <br><li><strong style="color: #17a2b8;">Interpreted Language:</strong> Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier and allows for rapid prototyping.</li>
        <br><li><strong style="color: #ffc107;">Dynamically Typed:</strong> Variables in Python do not require an explicit declaration to reserve memory space, and the type of a variable is determined at runtime.</li>
        <br><li><strong style="color: #dc3545;">Cross-Platform:</strong> Python can run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without requiring modification.</li>
        <br><li><strong style="color: #007bff;">Object-Oriented:</strong> Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code.</li>
        <br><li><strong style="color: #6f42c1;">Open Source:</strong> Python is open-source, which means it is freely available for anyone to use and modify. It has a large and active community that contributes to its development and improvement.</li>
      </ul>
